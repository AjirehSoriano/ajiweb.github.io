									<p>Just like a normal person, we all have dreams, we all have goals and to achieve those we must take full control of our lives and we must start accepting and conquering challenges, Enemies, Friends, and Love Ones come into our lives to prove that we are not alone
									, Such events in life may or may not stay on our memories forever but I sure know that with Pictures and the warmness in our hearts, the people and the things we passed through we always serve as a lesson that will help us Succeed in Life.</p>

												<h3>BECOMING A COLLEGE STUDENT</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As soon as I graduate from Junior High, I thought to myself that I should take a Senior High Track that is always about Editing Pictures and Animating Stuff, as I enrolled in the University of the Cordilleras, I was shocked and the world of programming surprised me, What I expect was more on drawing and editing, but no, neither pictures or videos are we editing, but its codes we are always compiling and programs we are going to execute. I tried my best to learn Java Programming and to have advance learnings towards it, and it paid off. I was able to graduate from University of the Cordilleras as a K-12 Curriculum Finisher, and from that day on, I decided that I shall continue my Journey by taking up computer Science.</p>

												<h3>Dancing is Actually Fun</h3>
											</header>
											<p>PHYSICAL EDUCATION, I always thought it was about running, punching and carry stuffs, but no! It's often dancing! I hate dancing, specially infront of many people, but when grades are at stake, I must do it even if I want it or not. Luckily, we can pick the group members we want to dance with
											so I, my friends and other friends grouped as one to make the silliest team. We practice and make formations, our teacher is so impressed that you can hear him say "Wow!,Nice!". Even though we are not that good in dancing, we know how to work as a team and make steps that everyone can follow so no one will be left out</p>

												<h3>Break Up</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Hmm, I don't know what else to put under my events blog so I put our Break Up. The girl in the picture is obviously my ex-girlfriend, I was always so busy for school and she's begging for attention, I give her attention when I have time, but all things comes to an end. She decided to break up with me and for me
											it's like "Okay, if that's what you want", I don't know if I'll be sad or happy, sad because I lost an important person in my life, but if a relationship is becoming as toxic and as bad, it's better to just end it. She starts being an hipocrite and paranoid, she thinks I'm seeing other girls, which I am not, When my Facebook got hacked she thought another girl was using it.
											I guess I grew tired of explaining so I just let her end it.</p>

												<h3>My Facebook and Gmail got hacked</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I don't think it's necessary to put that in here, but for content and story telling, okay! My Facebook got hacked and my Gmail Account as well, the hacker somehow got access to my gmail and facebook account, he/she deleted my accounts, so I took action and recovered  my Facebook account by taking a picture that I really am the owner of the account. Unfortunately,
											I wasn't able to recovery my gmail account so I just made another one.</p>
