										<h2>Single Parent Family</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The single parent family consists of one parent raising one or more children on his/her own. Me and my brother was raised by our mother. We are currently leaving in Quarry and my mom works at Dubai and as for my sister well, she was raised by my Father, they live at Loakan along with my other relatives on the father-side and I sometimes visit them to get along as I do not see them everyday.
									It's so sad we were born in this world with a broken family, but our relationship will never be different, my father always visits us and my mother supports my sister if she needs that motherly love
									When the three of us are together (Me, My brother, My Sister). We hang out and talk like we lived together for years even though we only meet once in a while. My Mother sacrifice for us will motivate
									us to do good in our studies as she now works overseas for bigger income. I wish I could tell you guys more about my family but it would fill an page if I do so. As for now let me introduce you to MY FAMILY!</p>

												<h3>ALIJAH JEVIN SORIANO</h3>

											<p>Bruh, the eldest of the Family, back when we were kids, we fight a lot like physically and verbally, but now, yeah we still fight but through words mostly. Anyway, My brother is currently studying in Saint Louise University under the course of Mechanical Engineering, my brother likes dogs and cats, making our house look like a zoo (We have 2 cats, 2 kittens and 2 dogs by the way)
											   I thought it wouldn't be a problem as he has a lot of free time until he starts slacking of and spends most of his time on his room or playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (Computer Game), atleast we have some help from our Aunt, we call her 'Tita Dorie'. She takes care of us since our mother is in another country. Going back to my brother, even if we fight a lot we are still brothers, same mother and oh! I forgot to mention that we are only half brothers (his father and my father are not the same) but after almost 18 years living together, 
											   We feel like we are full brothers and we already memorize the faces of one another.</p>

												<h3>ATHEA DANIELLE DAEP</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I don't even know if I spelled her name correctly lol. My sister is the most beaut..... most emotional person you'll ever meet, she always has a problem towards her boyfriend or I don't know, sometimes my dad (I am always the judge whenever she introduces a guy to us), she cries when she's drunk and It's just so funny.
											She is someone you can call a selfie addict, wherever we go, whatever ocassion it is, she is holding her Iphone4 or Iphone5 I think (Im not a fan of Iphone) and she smiles and ducks face everywhere and every angle, She is currently studying in the University of the Philippines Baguio under the course of Economics. Being an 'Economist'
											she is like a walking Newspaper, she is my source of knowledge towards politics and she is my source of awareness as I don't watch the news that much. Here is my Sister's Page, if you add her as a friend then beware as your facebook's newsfeed will be flooded by here drama and duck face. </p>

												<h3>SYLVANIA SORIANO</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Trust me, everyone will want to have an aunt like here. As you can see I don't seem to have a picture of her, want to know why? It's because she is a photographer, she is always the one taking photos during our trips and hangouts
											   She is very mature and an open-minded person, When she gives us words of wisdom, she somehow manages to motivates us. She is like our Second Mother, We love our 'Tita Syl' so much, she support us and she never stopped helping my mom (She is my mom's older sister).
											   She treats us during her free times and she is always present during our birthdays, she gives us gifts, but the most important thing that she gave and will always give are the lessons of life and also, the UNENDING love of an auntie.</p>
